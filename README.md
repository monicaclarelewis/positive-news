## Description

Positive Vibes gives the user mood-boosting media at the click of a button!

The internet is an amazing place full of interesting content, but a lot of it is negative. We have created a site that allows the user to visit somewhere that has guaranteed positive content, without accidentally scrolling to something that will ruin your day. 

The main technologies we used were React, Tailwind CSS and API's to create this app.


## Installation

Use the link above to visit the site, this will take you to the home page. Click the 'MAKE ME HAPPY!' button to be taken to a mood board of positive content.


## Usage

ADD!
